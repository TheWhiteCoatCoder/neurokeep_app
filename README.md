# NeuroKeep

**NeuroKeep** is a healthcare-focused mobile platform designed to improve medication adherence and daily cognitive support for people living with dementia, while reducing stress and uncertainty for caregivers and healthcare providers.


## 🧠 Problem

Dementia affects memory, attention, and executive function.  
One of the most immediate and dangerous consequences is **medication non-adherence**:

- Missed or incorrect doses
- Increased hospitalizations
- Accelerated cognitive and physical decline
- High emotional and logistical burden on caregivers

Traditional solutions (alarms, pill boxes, manual reminders) fail as cognitive function declines. They are rigid, non-contextual, and caregiver-dependent.

## 💡 Solution

**NeuroKeep** is a cross-platform, AI-assisted care companion that begins with medication adherence and expands into broader dementia support.

The system is designed around three principles:
- **Simplicity for patients**
- **Visibility for caregivers**
- **Intelligence that adapts, not overwhelms**

---

## 🚀 MVP Focus

The first version of NeuroKeep (MVP) focuses on solving the **core daily crisis**:

### MVP Features
- Simple medication reminders
- One-tap confirmation of intake
- Missed-dose detection
- Caregiver visibility (logs & alerts)
- Accessibility-first UI (large text, minimal interaction)

The MVP intentionally avoids over-automation and focuses on **reliability and usability**.

## 🤖 Future Roadmap 

- Context-aware smart reminders (AI personalization)
- On-device prediction using lightweight ML models
- Cognitive training modules (research-backed)
- Wearable integration
- B2B dashboards for clinics and care facilities

---

## 🏗️ Technical Stack (Planned)

**Frontend**
- Flutter (cross-platform)
- MVVM architecture
- Riverpod for state management

**Backend**
- Secure API layer
- Role-based access (patient / caregiver)
- Encrypted data storage

**AI (Future Phase)**
- Model training using clinical + anonymized behavioral data
- XGBoost / lightweight models
- On-device inference 

**Privacy & Security**
- Data minimization
- End-to-end encryption
- On-device inference where possible
- GDPR/HIPAA-aware design

---

## 🧪 Validation

The idea has been:
- Discussed with doctors and caregivers
- Tested as a Telegram bot prototype
